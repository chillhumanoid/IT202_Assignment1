				<h3>Hobbies?</h3>
				<p> It's a little hard to say what my hobbies are. I don't really have any.<br />
					I enjoy watching movies, and tv shows. I enjoy listening to music and  <br />
					I do that pretty much all the time. Also as a commuter, i've taken back<br />
					reading as it gives me something to do on the train. I play video games<br />
					but not a whole lot. I don't really have hobbies though. I also browse <br />
					the web a lot. My favorite site being <a href="http://www.reddit.com"> reddit</a> because it's a great way to<br />
					stay up to date on everything. Yea. so that's me. </p>
